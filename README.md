<summary>Description</summary>

Saves Dart (Flutter) dependencies. This Step needs to be used in combination with **Restore Dart Cache**.

This Step is based on [key-based caching](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/builds/caching/key-based-caching.html) and sets up the cache key and path automatically for Dart dependencies. If you'd like to change the cache key (or paths to cache), you might want to use the generic [Save cache](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/bitrise-step-save-cache) Step instead.

**Note:** this step's end-to-end tests (defined in `e2e/bitrise.yml`) are working with secrets which are intentionally not stored in this repo. External contributors won't be able to run those tests.
